     JavaScript</a> is an object-based script programming language. 
    This language is primarily used within web browsers and 
    has the ability to access built-in objects in other applications. 
    It is also used in server programming, such as runtime environments 
    such as Node.js. JavaScript was originally developed by Brendan 
    Eich of Netscape Communications Corporation under the name Mocha 
    and later as LiveScript, which ultimately became JavaScript.</p>

     Although JavaScript has some similarities in syntax with Sun 
    Microsystems' Java, this is because both languages 
    ​​are based on the basic syntax of the C language, 
    and the direct relationship between Java and JavaScript is weak.</p> 
    <p style="margin-top: 30px;">
     Other than the name and syntax, it has more similarities to Self 
    or Scheme than to Java. JavaScript is recognized as the 
    language that best implements the standard specifications of 
    ECMAScript, and was supported by default in most browsers until 
    ECMAScript 5 (ES5), but from ECMAScript 6 onwards, 
    it is compiled with a transpiler for browser compatibility.
